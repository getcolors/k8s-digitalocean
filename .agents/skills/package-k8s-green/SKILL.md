# kubeadm Kubernetes on DigitalOcean

Read [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) before changing
desired state or running a lifecycle command.

## Safety

- Keep secrets out of `colors.yml`; use ignored `COLORS_PAR_*` exports.
- Never set `COLORS_PAR_PROFILE` and never edit generated `.colors/` files.
- Default to `build` and `create --dry-run`; real create/delete needs explicit
  authorization.
- Keep `compute-prevent-destroy: true`. Lift it for one authorized delete with
  `COLORS_PAR_COMPUTE_PREVENT_DESTROY=false`.
- Restrict `digitalocean-ssh-sources` and `digitalocean-api-sources`; do not use
  `0.0.0.0/0` for administrative access.
- Do not copy `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`. `./green kubectl` uses it over SSH.

## Commands

```sh
./green build
./green create --dry-run
./green create
./green kubectl get nodes
./green kubectl get pods -A
./green delete
```

A real lifecycle run requires Babashka, OpenTofu, Ansible, and SSH. The provided
`devenv.nix` supplies them. Flux watches a public HTTPS repository and path.
Ensure that path contains the controller/config/application reconciliation
objects before provisioning.

Delete first asks Kubernetes to remove the ingress LoadBalancer and waits for
its service finalizer, then destroys only the deployment-owned Droplets,
firewalls, and VPC, and finally removes the deployment's SSH keypair.

The deployment owns its SSH keypair (keygen mode: leave `digitalocean-ssh-keys`
out of `colors.yml`; the first real `create` generates `~/.ssh/<profile>`,
registers it at DigitalOcean and names it in the `~/.ssh/config` block that
`ssh <profile>` and `kubectl` use). Supplying `digitalocean-ssh-keys` — an id
or fingerprint already on the account, the value this package used to take as
`digitalocean-ssh-key-fingerprint`, which is now refused by name — opts out and
uses your own key untouched.
